# The Baphomet Bazaar

A video game about selling magical items at a bazaar, using Godot Engine.

The game features a twist on the match-three flavour of gameplay, where your character is part of the board, through which you swap tiles and create matches.

The tiles you match act as ingredients to mix together, to fulfill recipes available to you.
